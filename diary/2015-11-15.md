Wrote a React Component that

1.) deep clones its children, decorating each with a ref callback which,
2.) upon mounting, writes the mounted DOM node into `this.elements` under
    the key `handle`, which is also written into the vDOM node as a nonce
    prop `handle`.
3.) `render()`s the cloned children
4.) upon mounting, iterates through the live DOM nodes in `this.elements`,
    writing their computed styles into `this.state`
5.) uses the updated styles to pre-calculate an array of Knuth & Plass
    glue/box/penalty formatting objects, using a pass of devongovett/linebreak,
    an implementation of the UAX14 algorithm, followed by a pass of
    bramstein/hypher with an English hyphenation dictionary.

1.) component is instantiated
2.) component renders ref-decorated children
3.) component collects styles from ref-decorated children in a loop
  a.) styles are used to recompute glueboxes, as fonts change
  b.) glueboxes are use to recompute breakpoints, as fonts and widths change
  c.) breakpoints are used to re-render the paragraph

Right now we are implicitly

  lang="en-us"
  style="{
    text-align: justify,
    text-align-last: left
    text-indent: 0px,
    hyphens: auto,
    text-transform: none,
    white-space: normal
  }"

Todo:

1.) Hypher breaks "no&nbsp;break&nbsp;space" into ["no&nbsp;break&nbsp;", "space"].

2.) Linebreak does not break ' hello' into ' ' and 'hello'.

2.) Linebreak's dependence on brfs wrecks our build times

3.) Text-transform will be hard to re-implement without a good unicode library.

4.) We need to calculate and include a "kern" value along with the correctly
    kerned "width" value for soft hyphens instead of just measuring an nbsp.

5.) We need to memoize calls to measureText and common formatting objects
    (glues, soft hyphens, EOL)

6.) God forbid, bidi.

7.) Lazy load hyphenation dictionaries
