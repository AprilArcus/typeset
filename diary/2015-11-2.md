API changes & micro-optimizations:

We no longer return the initial null breakpoint in the list, so we don't
have to skip it while iterating. `active.data.line` is now 0-indexed.

Linebreak now returns `{positions: Array<number>; ratios: Array<number>}`
instead of `Array<{position: number; ratio: number}>`, and pre-allocates
the arrays using the Array constructor `new Array(bestActiveNode.data.line + 1)`.

This means the returned result requires two allocations instead of being
O(breakpoints) in size. Since we can index into the result arrays using
`active.data.line`, we don't need to `Array#push` in a loop. Hardly matters
since breakpoints will nearly always be a small number, but makes me feel
good. If we decide to use a webworker to run the linebreaking computation,
it's less data to copy across threads.

If linebreaking fails, the result object contains an `error` member that
we can test for and throw if we care to do so.
